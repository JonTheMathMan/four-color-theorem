# four-color-theorem
I used c++ to test all possible color arangments for a map and found lots of answers to the four color theorem.

notice in my map that the inner to outer layers of the circle are labelled alphabetically and the sections going clockwise also are labelled alphabetically also. making the inner most section AA, the next layer consisting of BA BB BC and so forth.
